To report a security issue, please email security@buape.com with a full report of the issue you have found, including where you found it and steps to reproduce, in the body of that email.

Once you do, you will receive an email back with steps to proceed from there through our Vulnerability Disclosure Program.

This project follows a 30 day disclosure timeline, and will begin triaging within 24 hours of your report.

Note: We do not currently offer a bug bounty program.
