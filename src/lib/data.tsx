Many bots are either limited, vote-lock feature and/or put really cool features behind a paywall, but on the other hand, Kiai gives you so many options, such as setting your own formula for leveling and many other commands to easily modify how much XP people have. Additionally, it has a REST API, which I'm looking forward to integrate into a project I'm working on. The support team is relatively cool as well and replies back in a reasonable amount of time.",
